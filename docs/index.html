      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p class="about-text">
          With over 3 years of professional frontend web development experience,
          I have honed my skills and expertise in crafting modern and
          user-friendly web applications. My journey began with a passion for
          creating beautiful and functional interfaces, which eventually led me
          to specialize in frontend technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          My proficiency spans a range of technologies, including HTML5, CSS3,
          JavaScript, Typescript, React, Vue, and Node.js. These tools enable me
          to bring ideas to life, ensuring that websites are not only visually
          appealing but also perform optimally.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Throughout my career, I've demonstrated expertise in React JS
          components, forms, events, router setup, and animations. I've utilized
          the Redux architecture to enhance website performance and provide
          seamless user experiences. Whether collaborating within a team or
          working independently, I've consistently delivered exceptional
          results.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I'm well-versed in modern CSS layout and animation techniques, along
          with preprocessors that streamline the development process. My
          familiarity with automation tools like Webpack enables me to optimize
          workflows for efficiency.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I thrive in Agile/Sprint development processes, adapting to changing
          requirements and delivering solutions within tight timelines. My
          commitment to frontend excellence and a user-centric approach drives
          me to continuously learn and explore new technologies in this dynamic
          field.
