              <h3>Child Care project</h3>
            </a>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Project Name:</strong> SunnyChildCare</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Hey there! I had the awesome
                opportunity to build the web structure for SunnyChildCare. It's
                a platform designed specifically for child care centers, making
                it super user-friendly for both the staff and parents.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tech & Tools:</strong> I got my hands dirty with some
                cool tools and tech for this one. I used Html5, CSS, and JS for
                the frontend magic. Webpack helped me bundle everything
                together, and I managed the code with Git. On the backend, I
                used Node.js. Oh, and I can't forget Photoshop – it was super
                handy for some of the design elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Key Features & Highlights:</strong> One of the things
                I'm super proud of is the responsive design. No matter what
                device you're on, the site looks great. I also added a feature
                where customers can shoot over a form straight to a designated
                email – super convenient. And to make sure everyone knows where
                the center is, I integrated Google Maps to pinpoint the school's
                exact location.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> Ran into a bit of a
                hiccup with cross-domain issues. But no worries! With a combo of
                cors and express, I got that sorted out in no time.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Feedback & Results:</strong> Since we launched, there's
                been a 30% uptick in user registrations. Pretty neat, right?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What I Learned:</strong> One of the coolest things I
                picked up from this project was the art of color selection,
                especially in the realm of early childhood education. It's
                fascinating how different sectors have their own vibe and color
                palettes.

              <h3>Responsive Project Demo</h3>
            </a>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Project Name:</strong> Responsive Web Page</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Hey! I whipped up this design
                template for a responsive web page. The cool part? I used the
                principles of OOP to craft this beauty.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tech & Tools:</strong> I rolled up my sleeves and dived
                into HTML, CSS, and JS to bring this responsive web page to
                life.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Key Features & Highlights:</strong> I'm super stoked
                about the animations and the variety of component templates I've
                included. It's like a Swiss Army knife for web design!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> Merging components was
                a tad tricky, especially with some pesky padding and margin
                issues. But, thanks to the Chrome dev tool, I ironed out those
                wrinkles in no time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Project Link & Code:</strong> Wanna see it in action?
                Take a peek at my template right here:

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>What I Learned:</strong> The big takeaway? Using OOP to
                design reusable components is a game-changer. It's like having a
                secret weapon that saves heaps of time on future designs.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Project Name:</strong> Responsive Web Page</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Hey there! I crafted this sleek
                and simple template for a responsive web page. The goal? To
                showcase a clean and tidy style that's easy on the eyes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tech & Tools:</strong> I got down and dirty with HTML,
                CSS, JS, and a touch of Photoshop magic to design this
                responsive gem.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Key Features & Highlights:</strong> I designed a
                production-ready template and played around with various
                animations and styles to give it that extra flair.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> Ran into a snag with
                SVG files where the usual 'fill' trick wouldn't change the
                color. But guess what? I tackled it by tweaking the layer
                display in Photoshop.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Project Name:</strong> Scroll Animation</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Hey there! I took on this rad
                challenge to craft a cool scroll animation using just HTML/CSS,
                no JS allowed. Yep, you heard that right!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tech & Tools:</strong> I rolled up my sleeves and dived
                deep into HTML and CSS to bring this scroll animation to life.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Key Features & Highlights:</strong> The real
                showstopper? Creating that scroll bar animation without a hint
                of JS. Pure CSS magic!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> Going the no-JS route
                was a fresh experience, and yeah, it threw a few curveballs my
                way. But with the trusty dev tool by my side, I pinpointed the
                scroll bar's position to ensure the animation was on point.

                <strong>Description:</strong> Hey there! I dived into the new
                features of Next.js 13 by building a todo list. The main goal?
                To put those shiny new Next.js 13 features to the test.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tech & Tools:</strong> I geared up with the latest

                all with TailwindCSS.
